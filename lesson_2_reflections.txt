# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A `.git` folder is created. There are no commits at first.
You need to do it to prepare git for tracking.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only contains the files that you want to add ot the next 
commit and it lets you inspect what you're actually about to commit.
