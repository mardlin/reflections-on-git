# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A `.git` folder is created. There are no commits at first.
You need to do it to prepare git for tracking.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only contains the files that you want to add ot the next 
commit and it lets you inspect what you're actually about to commit. 

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

If you are making multiple changes at once, you can leave unrelated changes out of 
the staging area and not commit at the same time.

#What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help by separating work on major features. You could see where 
they were added into the Master branch by looking at merges.
