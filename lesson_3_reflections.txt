# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

For sharing and displaying my work, letting others make use of it, or 
collaborating with others. 

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might not want to make something public yet.
